# SSL certificates directory
#
# Place your SSL certificates here:
# - fullchain.pem (certificate + intermediate)
# - privkey.pem (private key)
#
# For development/staging, you can generate self-signed certs:
#   openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
#     -keyout privkey.pem -out fullchain.pem \
#     -subj "/CN=staging.resuboost.ai"
#
# For production, use Let's Encrypt or another CA.
